This implements an ImageJ/FIJI plug-in working with 8-bit time-lapse stacks of 2D images. It is deemed to work with two-photon images obtained whilst perifusing the tissue (e.g. pancreatic islets) with polar tracer. The plug-in used DoG algorithm for contrasting the small objects (endocytotic vesicles/network), segments the image to reveal individual cells and then calculates the numbers of endocytotic vesicles within each cell.
